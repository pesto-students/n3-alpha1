1. move stories out of src, preferrably to a new stories folder in root
2. move src/design-system/css to .storybook
3. merge app components, scss within pages; the structure would be like:
     - pages
        - Home
          - components
          - Home.tsx
          - home.scss
4. Point 3 for design system too
5. React final form integration with form inputs in design system (can be touched when we reach checkout)
